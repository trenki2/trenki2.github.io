SDL2_image is an add-on library for SDL2, the Simple DirectMedia Layer and can
be used to load images from various formats. In this post I describe how to get
it working with CMake under Windows and Linux.

## CMake Module

To get SDL2_image working with CMake you need a `FindSDL2_image.cmake` CMake
module. Unfortunately CMake does not have one for SDL2_image but it has one for
the older SDL_image which can be adapted to work with SDL2_image.

This CMake module needs to be places somewhere inside your project source tree
for instance into a `cmake` subdirectory. You then need to also set the CMake
module path.

```cmake
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/")
```

When this is done you can find the `SDL2_image` package with the `find_package`
command. You might also have to set the `SDL2_DIR` cmake variable so that the
SDL directory is found.

```cmake
find_package(SDL2 REQUIRED)
find_package(SDL2_image REQUIRED)
include_directories(${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${SDL2_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(Exe ${SDL2_LIBRARIES} ${SDL2_IMAGE_LIBRARIES})
```

The source of the `FindSDL2_image.cmake` file that I am using is this one:

```cmake

# file Copyright.txt or https://cmake.org/licensing for details.

#.rst:
# FindSDL2_image
# -------------
#
# Locate SDL2_image library
#
# This module defines:
#
# ::
#
#   SDL2_IMAGE_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
#   SDL2_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
#   SDL2_IMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
#   SDL2_IMAGE_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the
#                              version of SDL_image
#
#
#
# For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:
#
# ::
#
#   SDL2IMAGE_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES)
#   SDL2IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS)
#   SDL2IMAGE_FOUND (same value as SDL_IMAGE_FOUND)
#
#
#
# $SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
# ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR used in building SDL.
#
# Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
# module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
